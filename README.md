Description:

This addon aids master looter in Molten Core instance to announce whose turn it is to loot the Core Hounds and Ancient Core Hounds.

 
Features:

-Addon can announce in raid chat whose turn it is to loot (can be turned off) 
-Addon shows whose turn it is in addon color (can be turned off)

-Addon (or rather master looter) wispers person whose turn it is to loot as a reminder to loot it.

-Addon can show which group members have it installed and enabled and which don't, this way its easy to track who is missing it.
-For proper functionality all group members need to have addon installed and disabled. In case where only some members of the group have the addon, it will do all above but only when members who have the addon are on turn to loot


History:
Addon doesn't do anything else than the things described above, its only purpose is to avoid loosing time while waiting for the person to realize its his turn to loot and not waste the time of active buffs.
